## Introduction

Discord bots are versatile tools that perform various operations in Discord servers. They can be customized to execute user-defined operations and can be built using many programming languages like Python, JavaScript, etc. Examples of bots and their actions include:

- **Information Bots**
  - Convey information to users.
  - Provide details about the server and its services.
- **Economy Bots**
  - Simulate a virtual economy system.
  - Allow users to buy and sell products like in games.
- **Ticket Bots**
  - Facilitate private discussions by creating new channels.
  - Open a ticket which creates a new channel, where someone will accept the ticket and respond to the user's queries.
- **Moderation Bots**
  - Maintain a safe and healthy community by taking action against rule violators.
  - Actions can range from warnings to kicking or banning users.

## Why Do We Need Bots?

- In large servers with thousands of members, staff cannot manually moderate or perform all necessary actions.
- Bots automate these tasks, ensuring efficiency and consistency.

## Topics to be Covered

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of creating a Discord information bot and provide a foundation that can be applied to more complex bots. The topics covered include:

## Basic Python Concepts

This section covers essential Python concepts including docstrings, functions, decorators, and classes. Understanding these concepts is crucial for bot development.

## Asynchronous Programming in Python

Learn the basics of asynchronous programming using the `asyncio` library. This section explains how to handle concurrent tasks efficiently, which is essential for creating responsive bots.

## Discord Developer Platform

Instructions on setting up your bot on the Discord Developer Platform. This includes creating a new application, configuring settings, and generating an invite link for your bot.

## Types of Commands

Explore different types of commands that can be used in Discord bots:

1. **Slash Commands**
2. **Message Context Commands**
3. **Hybrid Commands**

## Discordpy Library

A detailed guide on using the Discordpy library to build your bot. This section covers the basics of bot structure, events, event handlers, and command creation.

## Cogs

Cogs are used for organizing your bot's commands and events into separate files for better modularity and maintainability. This section provides a template and instructions for using cogs.

## Using Learned Concepts

Practical examples of applying the concepts learned in previous sections to build a functional Discord bot.
